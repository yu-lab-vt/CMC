Description: Detection of driving transcription factors (TFs) for a set of co-expression genes. 
    The cell type specific TF binding sites are extracted from mouse ChIP-seq database. In this 
    package, CMC model is utilized to systematically model the gene/TF heterogeneity in binding 
    affinities, and enables a more powerful detection.
